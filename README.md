### FeathersJS

This repo contains two apps. One basic app to understand the minimal working of FeathersJS and
one chat app to understand the fundamental blocks of FeathersJS

- To run the basic app

```
cd feathers-basic
node app.js
```

The app will be running on http://localhost:3030.

- To run the chat application

```
cd feathers-chat
npm run dev
```

**Note**: To use the GitHub login, you have to make your own app on github and use its `client_id` and `client_secret`. To do that, follow the docs here: https://docs.feathersjs.com/guides/basics/authentication.html#github-login-oauth
